# EVENTSKG Updater: A Java API for EVENTSKG
To ensure the sustainability of EVENTSKG, we developed an API for updating and maintaining the dataset. It facilitates the creation and the modification of EVENTSKG resources without going into the details of how this data is represented in the dataset.

## Features

- read the dataset from its online repository
- load the dataset from a local file
- report a dataset issue
- report aa API issue
- update the metadata of a particular resource
- add new resouces, i.e. events
- open the documentation page of the dataset
